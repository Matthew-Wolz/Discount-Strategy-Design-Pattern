Shopping Cart Simulation with Strategy Pattern

This project simulates an online shopping cart using the Strategy design pattern in Java. The goal is to allow different discount strategies to be applied to an original price dynamically, demonstrating the power of encapsulation and interchangeability of algorithms.

The assignment will incorporate the following classes for the Strategy pattern:

1. DiscountStrategy.java (Interface)
2. NoDiscount.java (Algorithm)
3. PercentageDiscount.java (Algorithm)
4. FixedDiscount.java (Algorithm)
5. ShoppingCart.java
6. Main.java
